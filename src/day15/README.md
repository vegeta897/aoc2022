## Notes

Another classic AoC where part 2 does not let you brute-force the solution (well, on a fast computer and with enough time you might be able to). I don't feel like refactoring or cleaning this up. I'm satisfied that I figured out the trick, but kicking myself because I almost had the right idea earlier on while trying to find shortcuts for crawling the whole map.
