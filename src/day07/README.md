## Notes

Very happy with today's work. It was one of those days in which the first solution I thought of ended up working right away, and felt clean to write on the first try.

It wound up being even simpler than I initially thought. I expected to have to keep track of the children of each directory, when all I really had to do was make sure each file parsed added to the total sizes of each parent directory.
