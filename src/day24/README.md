## Notes

This seemed much scarier than it ended up being. I figured out that the blizzard patterns would repeat after a certain amount of time. State could be tracked and cached with just your position and the minute. I hit some speed bumps when debugging the code that invalidated certain illegal moves.

Also, my code for part 2 fails to match the example answer, but gave me the correct answer for my input. Go figure! Leaving in some temp code in case I want to go back and figure out why that's happening.
