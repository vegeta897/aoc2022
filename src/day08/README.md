## Notes

Not a great performance today. My code was ugly and repetitive, and some silly mistakes (plus my internet going out) slowed me down.

Part 2 seemed somewhat easier. Right before I could submit, my internet went down. I had to frantically log in on my phone, which included GitHub's 2-factor sign in, to submit. I was still slower than I should have been though.

My post-submission refactor may not be the best, but it's all I feel like doing.
