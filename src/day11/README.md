## Notes

This was painful. Part 1 was easy enough*, but part 2 absolutely requires critical thinking if you don't know the trick right away. I tried a lot of dumb things that I didn't expect to work, and they didn't. I was in the vicinity of the right idea, but it took a while to nail it.

\* _Well, kind of. I really need to refresh my memory on how to parse values out of strings with regex\*\*, rather than using clunky substrings_

\*\* _I went and updated the parsing with regexes._ Still don't quite love how JS regex match extraction works, but I hope I can get fast and reliable with writing these.
