## Notes

More permutations!

I immediately liked the premise of this one, because it felt so much like a Factorio-style game. The challenge here was ruling out as many fail-states as possible. Caching seemed to have no purpose, unless I was just doing it wrong.

There is certainly more room for optimizing here, but the cruel thing is that blueprint #2 in the example input takes _soooo long_ to evaluate in part 2, whereas my actual input goes through part 2 in just 20 seconds. If I had just tried that sooner, instead of waiting for the test, I could have submitted much sooner.
